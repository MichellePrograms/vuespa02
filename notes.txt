editorconfig.org


check on version: use git cmd or git bash
node package manager
npm -v
version in tutorial is 5.3.0
installed verison from internet is 5.6.0

git bash change directory to C:\Users\Mine\source\pluralSite\vuespa02
cd ..
cd "Mine/source/pluralSite/vuespa02"


comment out all the stuff in the 02 package.json as dependencies

delete the package-lock.json

npm init -y

Wrote to C:\Users\Mine\source\pluralSite\vuespa02\package.json:


npm install vue@2.4.2 --SAVE
the --save is important,  save adds vue to dependencies in package.json


$ npm install vue@2.4.2 --save
+ vue@2.4.2
added 37 packages, removed 143 packages and updated 127 packages in 10.01s

$ npm install vue@2.4.2 --save
npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
+ vue@2.4.2
added 1 package in 0.825s


make sure you have the show all files/folders chosen to see the node_modules folder etc

 $npm install express@4.15.4 --save
this add of express get a crap ton of stuff in the node_modules

make server.js file

putting in the express package for the express server adds the package.lock.json
add and modify the server.js file

git bash cmd line
node server

go to localhost:3000 all return hey there
http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/user
http://localhost:3000/home


in package.json
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"

this means from command line you can type 'npm run start'
or 'npm start'  to kick of startup script, which can turn into a big deal
CTRL-C to stop node server running in command line



module bundler for the const refs usages in .js files, pollyfil in module bundler plugin for older browsers
webpack is the choice because it does a lot

make build folder and add a webpack.base.config.js
npm install webpack@3.5.5 --save-dev
puts it up in the package.json dev dependencies

work on the app.js, client-entry.js , and the webpack.base.config

commandline
node ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack --config ./build/webpack.base.config.js

 node ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack --config ./build/webpack.base.config.js

 webpack creates us our dis > assets > js > app.js file
 all this includes the pollyfill code from our setup thru webpack.base > client-entry > app

 re-run webpack and do npm start after changing the things to see page

 seeing SCRIPT1002: Syntax error
app.js (1,1)
view source and see what is going on and test in all the browsers
chrome shows unexpected token <


make sure to have correct binding between the app.js src file and the index.html file!!!!
//template stuffs was there from initial pull
make sure to have RIGHT js file location path!!! coming from dist folder



to not have to manually run webpack to rebuild the dist file contents every time
and stop and restart our local dev server
and make things more effective in development, install webpack-dev-middleware and webpack hot

run on cmd line
npm install webpack-dev-middleware@1.12.0 webpack-hot-middleware@2.18.2 --save-dev

adjusting configuration files and reruning npm start
getting error
C:\Users\Mine\AppData\Roaming\npm-cache\_logs
ensure the webpack.clien.config and dev-server js file align
npm now started fine

error loading page
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
<script src="dist/assets/js/app.js"></script
server cannot find this resource script
look at the cmd for when the node started up......

now coming from assets/js/app.js not have dist in the file path


change to data in vue app object causes the server
to reload resources
not auto reloading the browser page though even with
the hot middleware module loaded

revising your webpack setup
make sure to read your used modules readme.md file
C:\Users\Mine\source\pluralSite\vuespa02\node_modules\webpack-hot-middleware\README.md
we see much more loaded now when npm starts ups
